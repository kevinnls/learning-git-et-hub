okay so this is just a file
let's assume these are the changes
get rid of the terminal
make changes to the file
save it
that's git automatically checking the changes
so if i added another file for example
keeps checking keeps adding
now these are not staged changes
so committing won't work
oh well
they did
i didn't expect that lol
and now i'm changing the file which is why there's bluee line no the left
and that over there
